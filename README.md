# Installation & Usage

1. Download or clone the repo into a folder.
   * Check out the develop branch if you want the absolute latest but possibly buggy updates.
   * If using ZIP download, extract and overwrite your current folder to update.
   * Since v1.3.2 Veera will notify about updates; once for commits, every startup for releases.
2. In your Chrome extensions page, click "Load unpacked" and point to the repo folder.
   * Make sure developer mode is enabled if you don't see the button.
   * To recompile after changes, hit the reload button beneath the extension.
   * To remove the developer notification when you start Chrome, use the "pack extension" button and use its output instead of the folder. That should work, probably. You will have to repeat this for every update.
1. Load Granblue and hit F12 to bring up the Chrome devtools.
2. Navigate to the Veera tab.
   * You can re-order the tabs here if you wish.
3. NEW USERS: On first install it is recommended to visit the supplies page in-game (all tabs) once to load its data and restart Veera.

Note that Veera can't track things if it is not active (the UI must be loaded).
If any desync happens it can be fixed by visiting the relevant in-game page in most cases.
Feel free to ask questions on the Issues page. They could even lead to bug fixes or improved functionality.
